# Human-memory
A repository for computational models of human memory

I'm a beginner! Anyone who is at the similar level who wants to learn about
models for human memory is welcome to participate in this repo.
The goal is ultimately to just learn about the dynamics of connected neurons,
their learning rules, and how our minds work!

I'm also trying to focus on biologically feasible systems. 


WIP:
1. Self organizing map/ Kohonen net (implemented in Javascript):

I would like to explore how neurons could exhibit this kind of activity with
biological constraints. For example, the kohonen net is based on comparative
error, and I'm not sure if neurons would ever be able to do such precise
calculations by only summing dendrite inputs.

2. Hopfield net(implemented in python): I've only just started working on this one, and am still
reading about the network dynamics, inputs, outputs, and training.
